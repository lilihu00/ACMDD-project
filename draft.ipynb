    "### Introduction\n",
    "The human body holds a complex network of various signaling receptors that are involved in a wide range of physiological processes. Amongst them, the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor (A<sub>1</sub>R), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is a pivotal mediator. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the brain, heart, and vasculature, and plays a crucial role in modulating neurotransmission, neuronal activity, and cardiovascular homeostasis.<sup>1</sup> Considering its involvement in these processes, A<sub>1</sub>R has shown to be involved in numerous disorders, including neurological and cardiovascular conditions.<sup>2,3</sup> For instance, chronic agonistic activation of A<sub>1</sub>R has been linked with A1R-dependent accumulation of a-synuclein, which on long-term promotes neurodegeneration.<sup>4,5</sup> Consequently, A<sub>1</sub>R has been suggested as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.<sup>6</sup> Furthermore, the implications of A<sub>1</sub>R overexpression also extend to cardiovascular conditions like ischemic strokes. Activation of the A<sub>1</sub> receptor during ischemic events has shown to aggravate neuronal damage and lead to increased infarct size.<sup>7</sup> Thus, the use of A<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists may be a potential treatment option to alleviate the detrimental effects of an ischemic stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the A<sub>1</sub>R is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of a single polypeptide chain that transverses the membrane from the extracellular side beginning at the N-terminus to form seven transmembrane helices (TMs).<sup>8</sup> It is made up of 326 amino acids and has an approximate mass of 36.5 kDa.<sup>9</sup> Besides the A<sub>1</sub>R, there are 3 other subtypes of adenosine receptor, namely, A<sub>2</sub>A, A<sub>2</sub>B and A<sub>3</sub>. All of these adenosine receptor subtypes are nonselectively activated by the endogenous ligand adenosine.<sup>10</sup> The A<sub>1</sub> receptor preferentially couples to the G<sub>i</sub> protein to inhibit adenylate cyclase after activation, and consequently the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP).<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the A<sub>1</sub>R playing a pivotal role in cardiac, renal and neuronal processes, it remains poorly targeted by drugs. There are very few A<sub>1</sub>R drugs that have successfully progressed through clinical trials and currently no A<sub>1</sub>R drugs actually on the market.<sup>9</sup> The downfall of A<sub>1</sub>R drugs is often considered to be a consequence of widespread distribution of the receptor which can cause a lot of off-target effects. Some A<sub>1</sub>R ligands that have been developed are n6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CPA), naxifylline and rolofylline. CPA is an A<sub>1</sub>R agonist that was developed as an anti-nociceptive agent, however it has a lot of cardiovascular side effects.<sup>11</sup> Naxifylline was created for the treatment of congestive heart failure, but it has side effects including headache, irregular heart beat, irregular breathing and difficulty sleeping.<sup>8</sup> Rolofylline is a diuretic for acute heart failure, but causes off-target strokes.<sup>9</sup> Seeing as none of the A<sub>1</sub>R drugs are on the market, there are no ATC codes from which to gather more information about the drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Adenosine 1 receptor is intricately linked to neurological and cardiovascular conditions, including Parkinson's disease and ischemic stroke. The use of A<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists has shown promise in managing these conditions, but off-target effects often limit entrance into the market. In order to identify novel therapeutic options, investigating new possible antagonists using machine learning and docking simulations has garnered considerable interest. They facilitate the screening of large libraries of compounds and aid in identifying potential ligands that can interact with the A<sub>1</sub> receptor with high affinity, ultimately leading to the development of more effective therapeutic interventions. For this reason, both of these computational methods will be utilized, aiming to design novel ligands that can target the A<sub>1</sub>R with a higher affinity than the co-crystallized ligand DU172 (DU1).<sup>9</sup> In short, machine learning and molecular docking will be employed to predict the affinity of DU1 towards A<sub>1</sub>R. To this end, two different docking software will be used, namely, Autodock Vina and ICM pro of Molsoft. After the prediction of the docking scores, binding poses and the binding site of DU1 and ligand candidates will be evaluated.\n",

    "First, the A<sub>1</sub>R receptor sequence was acquired through UniProt. Using this sequence, similar targets were found. This was done to evaluate through which receptors off-target effects could potentially be induced. The A<sub>1</sub>R expressed in humans has an accession number of P30542, and an PDB ID of 5UEN. Based on the sequence of the A<sub>1</sub>R receptor (Target 0), a similar receptor was found through a BLAST run on UniProt. This was Target 1 with an accession number Q5RF57. Another BLAST run was done based on the sequence of Target 1 generating Target 2. An overview of these three targets can be found in *Table 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the similarity of the targets, the A<sub>1</sub>R of the sumatran orangutan (Target 1) was more similar to Target 0, the human A<sub>1</sub>R, than the human A<sub>3</sub>R (Target 2). Target 0 and the sumatran orangutan Target 1 were 99.1% similar while the human Target 0 and Target 2 were only 47.8% similar. This was expected as the same protein in different species was compared against each other, and two different proteins in the same species. Therefore, it is no surprise that the same proteins have a high similarity score, even if they are from two different species.\n",

    "Next, the three proteins were aligned on their similarity, and the following physical properties: hydrophobicity, negativity, positivity, and aromaticity, as shown in *Figure 1*. The Sumatran orangutan A<sub>1</sub>R is more similar to the human A<sub>1</sub>R in the following fields: similarity, hydrophobicity, negativity, positivity and aromaticity. As the alignment shows, the A<sub>1</sub>R sumatran orangutan and human proteins have the same number of amino acids in their structure, while the human A<sub>3</sub>R has only 318 amino acids which contributes to its significant difference from both of the A<sub>1</sub>Rs.\n",

    "Besides sequence-based off-target search, a structure-based similarity search was performed through the RCSB Protein Data Bank. This was done based on the tertiary structure of the human A<sub>1</sub>R crystal structure. The most similar protein, the human serotonin 2A receptor (PDB ID: 7WC4), was then selected for alignment with the human A<sub>1</sub>R (PDB ID: 5UEN) using the iCn3D Structure Viewer. Alignment of the two protein complexes was done followed by realignment of the A-chains based on sequence alignment (Figure 2). The realignment root mean square deviations (RMSD) were 2.916 Å and 4.576 Å, respectively, suggesting general similarity between the two structures.\n",

    "As previously mentioned, the human A<sub>1</sub>R was crystallized with the antagonistic ligand DU1. To design an antagonist with higher affinity, it is of importance to investigate the key interactions between DU1 and the receptor. To this end, the 3D structure of both entities was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank and examined on protein viewer software. Receptor-ligand binding was evaluated using an NGL Viewer and MolStar. Binding evaluation shows that DU1 binding occurs between transmembrane 6 and 2, and according to literature this is potentially positioned in the primary binding site (Figure 3).<sup>9</sup> The location of the binding site and DU1 orientation in the binding pocket are both of importance for the validation of the molecular docking model. Furthermore, key interactions between the ligand and target residues within 5 Å of the ligand were investigated with a protein-ligand interaction profiler (PLIP) as shown in *Figure 4*. Multiple key interactions were observed, namely, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and π-stacking. Notably, most interactions were hydrophobic in nature, with one protein-ligand interaction classified as π-stacking. The π-stacking occurs between an aromatic group of the receptor and an aromatic ring in the xanthine of the ligand. Regarding the hydrogen bonds, the carboxyl groups in DU1 are particularly important for these interactions.\n",

    "Subsequently, the ligand and target were separated to achieve the target protein with an unoccupied orthosteric binding site, using the coordinates from RCSB and BioPython. Prior to further evaluation and modelling, hydrogen atoms were added with LePro as the files retrieved from the RCSB PDB do not contain these atoms due to the limitations in the resolution of the experimental methods.\n",
